This is a simple gravitational n-body simulation routine written in C++. It uses Velocity Verlet integration to compute trajectories of n bodies. It outputs the body positions to a tab-seperated value file (can be opened in almost all text editors or spreadsheet applications). Simulations are set up with a simple text configuration file (an example "input_example.txt" is provided).

The only dependency is the [Boost QVM library](https://www.boost.org/).
