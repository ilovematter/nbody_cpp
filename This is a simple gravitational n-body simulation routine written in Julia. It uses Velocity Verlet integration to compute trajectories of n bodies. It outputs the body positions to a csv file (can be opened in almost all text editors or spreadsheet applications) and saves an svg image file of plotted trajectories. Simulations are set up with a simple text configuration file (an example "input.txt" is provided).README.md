This is a simple gravitational n-body simulation routine written in C++. It uses Velocity Verlet integration to compute trajectories of n bodies. It outputs the body positions to a csv file (can be opened in almost all text editors or spreadsheet applications) and saves an svg image file of plotted trajectories. Simulations are set up with a simple text configuration file (an example "input.txt" is provided).
